## Solution:
Just from listening to the `wavy.wav` i knew it was an **Audio Morse Code**
and to be completly honest the only tool i found is a web tool https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html 

Upload the `wavy.wav` and play it and wait for the 2 minute of Audio Morse Code to finish :)

This is what you gonna get after 2 minutes

but this is not the flag `S O M E T I M E S I T I S T H E P E O P L E N O O N E C A N I M A G I N E A N Y T H I N G O F W H O D O T H E T H I N G S N O O N E C A N I M A G I N E`

i had to make sense out of it and make a sentence.


Flag: `Aspire{SOMETIMES IT IS THE PEOPLE NO ONE CAN IMAGINE ANYTHING OF WHO DO THE THINGS NO ONE CAN IMAGINE}`
